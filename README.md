This project is developed for the International Seminar on Aerospace Science and Technology (ISAST 2024).
the project uses the X-Plane 11 flight simulator along with the SpaceX Starship SN-15 models developed by Milan Lisner[1].
The aim of this project is to land the Starship vertically and autonomously using various controllers and AI. YOLOv8 model for object detection will be used to detect the landing pad from the camera attached at the bottom of the Starship.
